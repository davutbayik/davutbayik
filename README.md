Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot extracts relevant context from the documents and provides intelligent, context-aware answers through a user-friendly custom Whatsapp inspired chat interface.
- **Technologies**: LangChain, OpenAI API, Google Gemini API, FAISS, Streamlit, PyPDF
- **Goal**: Empower users to interact with unstructured documents using conversational AI by combining retrieval and generation techniques, making document exploration faster, smarter, and more intuitive.

### 📲 [Auto WhatsApp Messaging](https://github.com/davutbayik/auto-whatsapp)
- **Description**: A Python-based automation tool that uses Selenium to send personalized WhatsApp messages through WhatsApp Web by simulating user interactions in a browser.
- **Technologies**: Python, Selenium WebDriver, Chromedriver.
- **Goal**: To streamline and automate the process of sending WhatsApp messages to individual or multiple contacts without manual intervention.

### 🔍 [NLP Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/davutbayik/metacritic-games-sentiment-analysis)
- **Description**: A sentiment analysis model that classifies metacritic reviews text data into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments using a fine-tuned BERT model.
- **Technologies**: Python, BERT, Hugging Face, NLTK
- **Goal**: To analyze user and critic reviews from metacritic games for insights into games sentiment.

### 🎮 [Metacritic Backend Scraper](https://github.com/davutbayik/metacritic-backend-scraper)
- **Description**: A custom OOP class for scraping metacritic games, movies and tv shows metadata and reviews from metacritic's backend API using requests.
- **Technologies**: Python, Requests, Pandas
- **Goal**: To efficiently extract structured, high-quality metadata and reviews for games, movies, and TV shows from Metacritic’s backend API—enabling deep analysis, sentiment mining, and recommendation system research without the overhead of frontend scraping.

### 🧠 [Social Network Ads Prediction](https://github.com/davutbayik/socialmedia-ads-purchase-prediction)
